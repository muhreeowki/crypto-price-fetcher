# Crypto Price Fetcher Microservice

This is a repo with code for a crypto price fetcher microservice I built in Golang to learn how to architect microservices. Its built fully with the go standard library (except for logrus for logging), and exposes both REST API and gRPC endpoints to allow access for both architectures.

## Requirements

- Go 1.22
- make
- docker
